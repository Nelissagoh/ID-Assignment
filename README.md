<h1> WORDIE - Daphne & Nelissa </h1>

<p> WORDIE is a word-guessing game similar to the game 'Hang-Man'. It is an inspiration from the game named 'Worldle' which when viral last year.
</p>

<p> How the game works is that the system will randomly generate a word, and the player will have to guess the word by typing in the letters that they feel is in the generated word. There will be limited amount of attempts or "guesses" for the player to key in their choice of letters, and the number of attempts will decrease by 1 each time they have guessed a letter wrongly. There will be a hint provided, and a section where it shows the incorrect letters that the player had key in. If the player is not able to guess the word within the attempts given, they will lose the game. If they manage to guess the word correctly within the amount of attempts, they will win the game.
</p>

<h2> Design Process </h2>

<p> This game is suitable for everyone! If you are on your way back home from school or work, this is the perfect game for you to kill time if you are bored! If you enjoy playing games related to words, this is the game for you too! By creating this game, my team hopes that everyone who plays this game can find this game enjoyable wherever and whenever they play it!
